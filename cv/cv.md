I am changing careers following a number of years working as an academic university lecturer in music technology. I’m now developing my skills as a software engineer by building personal projects and applying my creativity and analytical thinking to real-world problems.

## Technical Skills: Full-Stack

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, HTML, CSS;
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Express.js, p5.js;
- **Databases & APIs:** SQL (Postgres, SQLite), RESTful APIs, OpenAPI/Swagger;
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux, Neovim, VS Code, Markdown, npm and PyPi packaging, LaTeX, AI-ready;
- **Testing & Deployment:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Docker, Unit Testing (pytest, mocha, jest), Render, Netlify, Supabase;
- **Other Skills:** Technical writing, research, agile practices, mentoring, public speaking and teaching.

I have contributed to the open-source project [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a creative-coding JavaScript library by the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/).

### [Grant Scribe](https://granter.onrender.com/) (React, TypeScript, Express, OpenAI API)

A project to apply skills in React, Typescript, CI/CD, and the OpenAI API. This SPA generates tailored research proposals from user input. Built with React, Node / Express backend, and RESTful API calls. Deployed via Render. Demonstrates component-based architecture, async data fetching, error handling.

### [scry](https://github.com/thrly/scry) (Python, SQL, CLI Tool)

A project to develop skills with data ingestion and database queries in Python. Leverages the Scryfall API and an SQLite database to view stats for MTG set releases and custom searches via the command line. Packaged and released through PyPi index.

### [clouddrift](https://github.com/thrly/clouddrift) (Node.js, CLI Tool)

Developed skills in npm packaging by creating and publishing a CLI module that generates animated ASCII clouds on the user's terminal using simplex noise. Demonstrates proficiency in package publishing, creative application of noise algorithms.

### [Pen Plotter Art](https://github.com/thrly/pen-plotter-resources) (p5.js, Arduino)

Interactive generative drawings using p5.js to design algorithmic visuals, and controlling a 3D-printed pen plotter. Applied skills in creative coding, SVG processing, hardware integration, and microcontroller programming.

### [Harmonic Synthesizer](https://github.com/thrly/harmonic-series-synth) (p5.sound, JavaScript)

Developed skills creating a browser-based synthesizer for demonstrating harmonic series relationships through real-time audio generation and UI controls. Used in educational settings for interactive music teaching.

### [Tempest](https://github.com/thrly/tempest) (ZMK Firmware, Hardware)

Designed and built a wireless 36-key split ergonomic keyboard running custom ZMK config (Zephyr). Learned about PCB layout, embedded firmware, and configuration.
