- **Other Skills:** Technical writing, research, agile working, mentoring, public speaking

I have contributed to the open-source project [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a creative-coding JavaScript library by the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/).

## Professional Experience

### [Lecturer, University of Leeds](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/488/dr-oliver-thurley) (2019 – present)

- Delivered lectures and workshops to technical and creative audiences on topics including JavaScript, p5.js, and Max/MSP. This includes my module "Computational Art" which introduces non-coders to JavaScript, using it to generate algorithmic art, music, and poetry as well as other digital arts.
- Designed new module restructure and part of the core development team for a new Music Technology programme, which recruited >40% of our School's undergraduate intake in 2024-25.
- Supervised software-based student projects involving procedural systems and interactive installations, including multi-channel audio diffusion systems, and music education apps.
- Produced technical documentation and live including tutorials to support independent learning and development, including a successful YouTube-partnered channel teaching the node-based programming language, Max/MSP.
- My tutored students' average grade is a high 2:1. (2023--25)

### Teaching Fellow, University of Leeds (2016 – 2019)

- Provision of technical teaching across BA, MA music technology and BSc electronic engineering programmes.
- Supported student development with structured project feedback, tutorials and supervision.
