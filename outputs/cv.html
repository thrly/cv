    <hr />
    <p>I am driven to learn and always strive to expand and develop my
    skills through applied projects. I combine a creative approach with
    strong analytical thinking, and am experienced in research,
    communication, and problem-solving. I am a fast learner and thrive
    when collaborating to design and build innovative solutions.
    Following a number of years working as an academic lecturer in music
    technology, I am now looking to change careers to software
    development to focus on my passion for code and collaboration.</p>
