I am driven to learn and always strive to expand and develop my skills
through applied projects. I combine a creative approach with strong
analytical thinking, and am experienced in research, communication, and
problem-solving. I am a fast learner and thrive when collaborating to
design and build innovative solutions. Following a number of years
working as an academic lecturer in music technology, I am now looking to
change careers to software development to focus on my passion for code
and collaboration.
